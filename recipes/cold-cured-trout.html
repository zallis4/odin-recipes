    <p>A riverside favorite made with foraged herbs and juniper berries.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound trout filets, skin on</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salt</li>
        <li>1/4 sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon crushed juniper berries</li>
        <li>1 large bunch fresh dill</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the salt, sugar, juniper berries, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the dill on a large sheet of butcher's paper. Place the trout filets skin-side down on the dill, then cover the filets with the salt mixture.</li>
        <li>Top the trout with the remaining dill and tightly bundle in the butcher's paper.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate the wrapped trout for 24-48 hours, turning the fillets every 12 hours to ensure even curing.</li>
        <li>After uring, remove trout from the butcher's paper and gently scrape off the dill and curing mixture.</li>
        <li>Thinly slice and serve with a dollop of mustard sauce or soured cream.</li>
    </ol>
