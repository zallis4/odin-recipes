# odin-recipes

This repo is for a simple HTML website that displays recipes.
The project allowed me to play around with links and images while getting more comfortable with the syntax used in HTML.

Recipes and images were pilfered from the following websites:
    -vikingwarriorshirts.com
    -modernfarmhouseeats.com
    -northwildkitchen.com
    -cookeatlivelove.com
